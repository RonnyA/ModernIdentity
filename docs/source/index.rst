Welcome to Modern Identity for Developers

The first goal of this program is to make you able to understand the difference between the identity services Microsoft offer so you can choose the correct for you. The alternatives are

* Azure Active Directory (AAD) - When you want to sell your solution to Enterprise customers
* Azure Active Directory B2C (AAD B2C) - When you want to sell your solution to consumers (and in some cases also Enterprises)

The second, and maybe the most important goal, is to make you able to integrate with Azure AD from your code.
