#1 Adding Authentication - Week 18
----------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers, we look how to add AZURE AD authentication to your app. First we introduce you to the important topics that are required to understand identity and authentication. After the theory and demos we will introduce you to some coding exercise that you can work on to further educate yourself in the form of "homework".

Agenda:

* What is Identity?
* How is identity handled in an application?
* Identity & Authorization using tokens
* How are tokens requested?
* How to use tokens to securely call an API
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A

#2 Permission and Consent framework - Week 21
---------------------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers we look at the Azure AD Consent Framework. This framework makes it possible to develop secure multi-tenant web, api and native client applications in the Cloud.  
The Microsoft identity platform implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization and OpenId protocols. These protocols are used to deliver a secure authorization and authorisation solution over insure networks like the internet. In order to allow application to use third-party APIs (like Graph) a Consent Framework is required so that administrator and users can securely consent access to their resources. In this webinar  you'll learn the different types of permissions and consent framework models for obtaining permissions from administrators and users to use them in your apps. 

Agenda:

* Defining Permissions and Requesting Consent
* Using Scopes to only give least privileges
* How does Microsoft use Permissions in their applications?
* Learn difference between Delegate and  Application Permissions
* Best practices for Permissions, Scopes and Consent Requests
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A

#3 Accessing and protecting API’s - Week 22
-------------------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers we look how you can create a more advanced application where identity flows from the clients towards your REST APIs. This allows to secure REST API with Azure AD authentication and allows you to create proper cloud ready authorization inside your APIs.

Agenda:

* Authentication versus Authorization
* Protecting an API with Azure AD 
* Use and Validation of Access Tokens 
* Authorize User versus your App with Delegated and Application Permissions
* Flowing identity thru Multiple APIs 
* Delegation access management to your customers with Roles and Groups
* Q&A

#4 Authorization 
----------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers we look at  how to authorized access to your Applications and API based on the signed in User, where you customer can control the required access. Using AppRoles and Groups you can delegate the user management to your customers Azure AD Tenants Administrators and allow your Application and API to rely on roles based access.

Agenda:

* App Roles and Groups
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A

#5 Azure Active Directory B2C - Week 24
---------------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers we look at B2C to allow to create a authentication solution that is agnostic to the identity providers of your customers. Azure B2C allows you to develop a solution that allows Social Media accounts (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, MSA, etc) and Enterprise Accounts (Azure AD, SalesForce, etc) to authenticate in your application in a seamless manner and have total control on the login experience.


Agenda:

* Introduction to B2C
* Authenticate with Social Media Account and Business Accounts to your application
* Adding custom IDP to B2C using policies
* Customizing the login experience with custom layouts and login flows
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A

#6 Best practices for securing your services - Week 25
------------------------------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers we look at  how to secure the secrets in your applications. The weakest link for OAuth and OpenID are the secrets that are required to build the trust to acquire an accesstoken. This session explain opens to secure these secrets such that no secrets are needed in the development, deployment and operations processes using Managed Identity Features of Azure.

Agenda:

* What secrets are needed?
* What is Managed Identity and Keyvault
* How to use Managed Identity and Keyvault to secure your secrets
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A
