#1 Adding Authentication - Week 18
----------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers, we look how to add AZURE AD authentication to your app. First we introduce you to the important topics that are required to understand identity and authentication. After the theory and demos we will introduce you to some coding exercise that you can work on to further educate yourself in the form of "homework".

Agenda:

* What is Identity?
* How is identity handled in an application?
* Identity & Authorization using tokens
* How are tokens requested?
* How to use tokens to securely call an API
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A

#2 Permission and Consent framework - Week 21
---------------------------------------------

In this deep dive webinar series for developers we look at the Azure AD Consent Framework. This framework makes it possible to develop secure multi-tenant web, api and native client applications in the Cloud.  
The Microsoft identity platform implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization and OpenId protocols. These protocols are used to deliver a secure authorization and authorisation solution over insure networks like the internet. In order to allow application to use third-party APIs (like Graph) a Consent Framework is required so that administrator and users can securely consent access to their resources. In this webinar  you'll learn the different types of permissions and consent framework models for obtaining permissions from administrators and users to use them in your apps. 

Agenda:

* Defining Permissions and Requesting Consent
* Using Scopes to only give least privileges
* How does Microsoft use Permissions in their applications?
* Learn difference between Delegate and  Application Permissions
* Best practices for Permissions, Scopes and Consent Requests
* Introduction to coding exercise
* Q&A
