Microsoft Identity documentation
================================


Microsoft identity platform documentation
-----------------------------------------
* Microsoft identity platform allows developers to build applications that sign in all Microsoft identities and get tokens to call Microsoft APIs like Microsoft Graph, or APIs you've built. This full-featured platform consists of an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant authentication service, open-source libraries, application registration and configuration, robust conceptual and reference documentation, quickstarts, code samples, tutorials, and how-to guides.

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols on the Microsoft identity platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The Microsoft identity platform endpoint for identity-as-a-service with industry standard protocols, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. While the service is standards-compliant, there can be subtle differences between any two implementations of these protocols. The information here will be useful if you choose to write your code by directly sending and handling HTTP requests or use a third party open-source library, rather than using one of our open-source libraries.

Microsoft identity platform authentication libraries
----------------------------------------------------

* The Microsoft identity platform endpoint supports the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 protocols. The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) is designed to work with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. You can also use open-source libraries that support OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0.
